# Meteor-iOS-Swift Boilerplate

Created by Kevin Chen, 2015.

This is an example server for communication with an [ObjectiveDDP](https://github.com/boundsj/ObjectiveDDP) enabled iOS application. The [corresponding example](http://google.com) is written in Swift, though obviously Objective-C is also usable.
